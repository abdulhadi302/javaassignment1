                        Algorithm 1


Find the highest mark and the lowest mark and print the result on the screen !


STEP1:  Start
STEP 2: Declare Float highestlowest marks
STEP 3: Initialize high Is equal to 0 and low is equal to 100
STEP 4: Declare array highlow in equl to (0,0)
STEP 5: Set for loop for marks for (int i=0;i<marks.length;i++)
STEP 6: If marks greater  then high 
STEP 7: Then high is equal to marks 
STEP 8: If marks less then low
STEP 9: Then low is equal to marks
STEP 10: If highlow is equal to high
STEP 11: And if hoghlow is equal to low
STEP 12: Then return highlow







                        Algorithm 2

Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the marks and print the result on the screen!
STEP 1: Start
STEP 2: Initialize highlowest is equal highlowest(marks)
STEP 3: Print highest Marks.
STEP 4: Declare mean  is equal calculatemean(marks)
STEP 5: Print The Mean
STEP 6: Print The Standard Deviation.
